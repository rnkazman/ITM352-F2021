<br>Trying the first WOD was a struggle (as were the rest). I was really struggling but figured it would be better to try and complete it and see where the holes were in my understanding, rather than just immediately watch the video. I do think that it would’ve been helpful to watch the video first, but I also think that for me, I learn by doing and by forming questions and really understanding and identifying what I don’t know. If I know I have no idea how to do something, then yes I’ll look at a solution. But for the first WOD I really wanted to try and tough it out. My first attempt went horribly. Although I wasn’t perfect after watching the solution, it showed me how to get to certain places that I couldn’t have known otherwise. Up until the first few steps, we had done similar things in class so I kind of knew what to do. However, I think on step five I wasn’t sure how to create a link and would not have figured it out without watching the solution. I didn’t know the tags and code necessary to format a link, and then to attach that link and make it work in the document was a whole other issue. My first try took about 22 minutes and I didn’t end up finishing. My next try took about the same time but this time I at least got through and could then try harder and harder to reduce my time. I didn’t want it to be just rote memory because that won’t help me. But I think at this stage, I have a good enough understanding of what’s happening to walk through the steps without just memorizing them.

I personally like the way I did the WOD’s. First struggling, then forming questions, then watching the solution, then practicing with different code, and then executing. I know it helps me learn by struggling first and forming my questions, then moving on to watching the screencast, and I think in later WOD’s I will try and practice the code first with different steps just to make sure I know how it works. Kind of like doing drills then doing a practice game. I knew I wasn’t going to figure out the tags to form a link, and I wasn’t going to figure out how to format each link to go to a webpage outside of the localhost (a big issue was figuring out how to make web pages go to the site I wanted). So after I was done I looked at the screencast and just punched in an alternate site just to see how it worked and that I knew the necessary tags to make a link, which really helped my understanding. I know I’ll have to do a refresher but I’m happy with the outcome.

<br>For WOD 2 I got stuck pretty early on since the majority of it was formatting. However, even after watching the videos and understanding what the WOD was meant to teach me, I encountered a big problem with my webpage not reloading correctly and was stumped for the rest of the night trying to figure out a solution of how to render the formatting that I had put into VS Code. It was a simple fix (hard resetting the page) which allowed me to see the changes that I had made to the document. My initial attempt was too difficult for me to finish so I ended up stopping the timer early and watching the solution. I knew I would not be able to figure out the formatting to load the necessary texts and color the page Ivory, so I decided to watch the solution. This followed my process of figuring out what I was stuck on and then looking at the solution. However, I got stuck a lot sooner than in WOD1 so that was disappointing.

<br>I thought this WOD was a lot more fun than the previous WOD, just because now we’re adding in graphics and color, so the website isn’t a jumble of words and some images. Although formatting and adding in different text isn’t very exciting, because I had to struggle so much and I had no idea what I was doing prior to watching the solution, I found it very rewarding finally seeing the background color and the new font show up on my webpage. I think something that really helped me was just knowing that the solution was there. That gave me a lot of security and allowed me to fail without worrying too much about it. I also knew that in the solutions, there was an explanation, which really helped me to understand the reasoning. I’m sure people can just look and memorize but I’ve always been more of a person who wants an explanation and that really helps me, especially with something like coding where a lot of steps are involved. If I know the reasoning behind it, then it makes it a lot easier for me to understand and apply my learning to more advanced problems. I also like practicing rather than just trying to watch the video then quickly going to the WOD again. Practicing just helps me to think through the reasoning again and allows my brain to really focus on what it’s supposed to be doing. For example, on WOD2, practicing the loading the fonts was helpful for me to walk myself through the reasoning that was shown in the video. So when it came time for the WOD, rather than just memorizing my way through, I had practiced the reasoning and that really helped me to get the code right.

<br>For WOD3, I already had my system down of struggling and then forming questions, watching the solution, practicing, and then finally executing. I think accepting that I was going to really struggle and have no idea what to do was also very good for my learning because that allowed me to just try things and fail, rather than worry about getting things right the first time. By expecting struggle, I felt a lot more comfortable failing and then being able to identify why I was failing and what I didn’t understand, to then hear the explanation is really helpful for me. Especially with a WOD like this that’s got a lot of moving parts (the others do as well) I found it really helpful to breakdown each component and practice it prior to attempting the WOD again. I did get stuck a few times but again just allowing myself to fail was a good mindset to have. I had some issues with the spacing of the lines when I was formatting the links and that really stumped me because I wasn’t sure what was happening. During the WOD, I attempted a few different ways to remedy (on my recording you can see me frantically trying to figure out different code to format correctly) my code but nothing was taking. I knew i wasn’t going to figure it out so I just went back to the solution and looked to see what I thought I was doing right and wrong. I think because I know this is a learning experience more than a grade, it makes is easier for me to learn since the stakes aren’t as high as say, an exam where I’m on a time crunch. I really like that about WODs since they aren’t nearly as stressful and are really learning tools for me. I got to play around with the different columns and try to space differently overall just try to manipulate the page differently, and I think that also helped me to get through this WOD.
